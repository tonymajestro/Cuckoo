This 2024 Christmas party featured Parker nearly getting his second win in a row with a respectable 4th place. This game came down to the wire with Rosie versus Anthony in final round. Anthony got his second win with an exciting pass-stay (also known as a pasta). But the best moments came after the game when Conner introduced the Majestros to a few of his family's Christmas day games. These included blowing out the most candles while saying 'Merry Christmas', scooping ribbons into pots while blindfolded, passing cotton balls from plate to plate while only using your mouth and a spoon, and using 'Reindeer hooves' (hands in solo cups) to collect the most marshmallows into your plate. Nono surprised us all by getting in the top two or three in nearly every game.
