notes: "This hyped game was all about the Corrells. Lorelei got to play her first game and get her first Cuckoo. The game ended with Gina and Jacob in the finals. After a controversial redraw (Anthony looked at the cards beforehand), Jacob sealed the deal with a Cuckoo. Other special moments include Spencer and Anna drawing Kings on the deck twice in a row, and Nono and Jacob getting a rare double-cu."
winners:
  - Jacob
  - Gina
  - Nono
  - Conner
