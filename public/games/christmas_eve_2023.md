notes: "We played to only 3 points since this was one of the largest games we've ever played. It was Abby's first game and Gargi's second game. Unfortunately for the Hamiltons, Abby and Owen were the first two knocked out. Gargi gets the first two points of the game but manages to stay in the game for a long time. Sarah wins with an exciting victory by knocking out Tony and Spencer at the same time."
winners:
  - Sarah
  - Tony
  - Spencer
